## Metapatterns

Metapatterns are Rant's version of an `eval` statement. They can generate code in a provided pattern, and then execute it. A metapattern is a tag that begins with a question mark:
```rant
[? ... ]
```

Code generated by a metapattern does not belong to the parent source. Therefore, if a metapattern creates a pattern that throws an error, the line and column numbers will be relative to the start of the generated code.

### Examples
The following example has a fifty percent chance of generating a query with a plural subtype:
```rant
[?\<noun{|.plural}\>]
```
When run, the engine will output either a `<noun>` or a `<noun-plural>` statement.

For a more useful example of a metapattern, consider this example:
```rant
[numfmt:verbal-en]
[rep:10]
[sep:\s]
[before:[caps:first]]
{
    [repnum]\s[?\<noun[notfirst:.plural]::=a\>]!
}
```
This will output a <noun.plural> on every iteration but the first. This produces output similar to the following:
```rant
One ant! Two ants! Three ants! Four ants! Five ants! Six ants! Seven ants! Eight ants! Nine ants! Ten ants!
